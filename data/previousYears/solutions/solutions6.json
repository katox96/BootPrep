        "answer": "D) All of the above",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is D) All of the above. Dead zones in the world's oceans and large lakes are areas where the dissolved oxygen levels are extremely low or depleted, leading to hypoxic or anoxic conditions. This is primarily caused by high biological oxygen demand, which is the result of excessive blooms of algae. These blooms occur due to the excess nutrients like nitrates and phosphates present in the water, often from agricultural runoff or sewage discharge. The excessive growth of algae consumes the available oxygen, leading to the formation of dead zones. Therefore, dead zones are characterized by all the mentioned factors."

        "answer": "C) Sweden",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is C) Sweden. Sweden has been successful in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by implementing the use of carbon tax. A carbon tax is a financial levy imposed on the carbon content of fossil fuels. It is designed to incentivize companies and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions by making it more costly to emit greenhouse gases. Sweden has implemented a carbon tax policy that has effectively reduced emissions and encouraged the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. The success of Sweden's carbon tax model has been recognized globally as an effective tool in mitigating climate change."

        "explanation": "One of the better achievements of Kanha National Park is the conservation of swamp deer from near extinction. The park has played a crucial role in protecting and increasing the population of swamp deer, also known as barasingha. These deer were once on the brink of extinction due to habitat loss and poaching, but through dedicated conservation efforts, their numbers have been revived. Kanha National Park's success in safeguarding the swamp deer population contributes to the preservation of biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem."

        "answer": "B) Nitrogen",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is B) Nitrogen. Chip manufacturers seal the packet in the presence of nitrogen to prevent oxidation of potato chips during storage. Nitrogen is an inert gas that displaces oxygen, reducing the oxygen concentration inside the packet. This helps to maintain the freshness and crispiness of the chips by minimizing the oxidation process, which can lead to the degradation of quality and the development of off-flavors. By creating a nitrogen-rich environment, the chip manufacturers can extend the shelf life of the chips and ensure that they remain crispy and delicious."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is A) A lichen. Litmus dye is extracted from a lichen, which is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium living in a mutualistic relationship. Lichens are known for their ability to produce natural dyes, and litmus dye is one such pigment. Litmus dye is commonly used as a pH indicator, changing color depending on whether a substance is acidic or basic. It is widely used in various applications, including laboratory testing, educational experiments, and industrial processes."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is C) Baking soda. When someone is suffering from the problem of acidity after overeating, one of the remedies is to consume baking soda. Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, acts as an antacid and helps neutralize the excess stomach acid that causes acidity. It can provide quick relief from symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. However, it is important to use baking soda in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as excessive consumption can have side effects. It is always advisable to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of acidity-related issues."

It is an alkaline solution and is commonly used as an antacid to neutralize excess stomach acid. The alkaline nature of milk of magnesia helps in reducing acidity and providing relief from symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. It is important to note that gastric juice, blood, and sodium chloride solution do not have a pH above 10."

        "answer": "D) Chlorophyll degradation",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is D) Chlorophyll degradation. Chlorophyll degradation is not a process that takes place during photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The process involves the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll, the conversion of light energy to chemical energy through a series of reactions, and the splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen to release oxygen gas. Chlorophyll degradation occurs during leaf senescence or when plants undergo stress or aging, but it is not directly involved in the process of photosynthesis."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is D) Fathometer. A fathometer is an instrument used for measuring the depth of the ocean or other bodies of water. It works by emitting sound waves or pulses of ultrasound into the water and measuring the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back after hitting the ocean floor. By knowing the speed of sound in water, the fathometer can calculate the depth based on the time taken for the sound waves to return. This instrument is commonly used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic research."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is C) Astronomical distance. A light year is a unit of measurement used in astronomy to represent the distance that light travels in one year in a vacuum. Since light travels at a constant speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, one light year is equivalent to about 9.461 trillion kilometers. It is used to express vast distances between celestial objects, such as stars, galaxies, and other astronomical phenomena. The term 'light year' emphasizes the concept that we are measuring the distance based on the time it takes for light to travel."
