        "explanation": "The answer is A) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct. According to a World Bank working paper, extreme poverty in India decreased to 10.2% in 2019 from 22.5% in 2011, based on the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS). This indicates a positive trend in poverty reduction in India during that period. The statement highlights the findings of the World Bank working paper and its use of the CPHS data to estimate poverty and inequality in India."

        "explanation": "The answer is D) Statement I is incorrect and Statement II is correct. The development expenditure of the Central Government includes defense expenditure and grants to states. Statement I is incorrect in stating that defense expenditure and grants to states are not part of the development expenditure. On the other hand, non-development expenditure does involve items such as interest payments and subsidies, as mentioned in Statement II. This clarification helps to understand the categorization of different types of government expenditure."

        "answer": "B) Both Statement 1 and Statement II are incorrect",
        "explanation": "The answer is B) Both Statement I and Statement II are incorrect. Deficit financing can potentially create inflation in an economy. When the government resorts to deficit financing by borrowing money to cover its expenditures, it increases the money supply, which can lead to inflationary pressures. Statement I is incorrect in suggesting that deficit financing cannot create inflation. Similarly, if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduces the cash reserve ratio, it actually encourages credit creation rather than causing a decline. Therefore, Statement II is also incorrect. These statements highlight the incorrect understanding of the relationship between deficit financing, inflation, and the impact of changes in the cash reserve ratio on credit creation."

        "explanation": "The answer is A) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct. Low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) often exhibit high prospective growth rates and high marginal productivities of capital. This implies that these countries have the potential for rapid economic growth and can benefit from increased investments in areas such as human capital, public infrastructure, and environmental protection. Statement I correctly highlights this characteristic of LICs and LMICs. Statement II emphasizes the need for these countries to borrow heavily to finance such investments, which aligns with their growth potential and development goals. Therefore, both statements are correct."

        "explanation": "The answer is C) Statement I is correct and Statement II is incorrect. The average SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Index score did decline in 2021 compared to 2020, and this decline can be attributed, at least in part, to the slow or non-existent recovery in poor and vulnerable countries. Statement I accurately highlights this decline in the SDG Index score. However, Statement II is incorrect in stating that the United States, Brazil, and the Russian Federation exhibit the most support for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs among G20 member states. The level of support for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs can vary among G20 member states and is not limited to these three countries. Therefore, Statement II is incorrect."

Statement 1 is incorrect as gross capital formation consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets and changes in the level of inventories, but it does not include additions to the fixed assets of the economy. Statement 2 is correct as net value added at factor cost represents the total factor payments made in an economy. Statement 3 is incorrect as the national income refers to the total income accruing to a country from economic activities only, excluding non-economic activities. Statement 4 is correct as in the process of moving from national income to personal income, we subtract incomes earned but not received and add incomes received but not currently earned.

Statement 1 is incorrect as the Positive Peace Index does not necessarily measure the positive peace of 143 countries; the number of countries covered may vary. Statement 2 is also incorrect as there is no mention of the Positive Peace Index covering 59.6 percent of the world population. However, Statement 3 is correct as positive peace is indeed defined as the attitudes, institutions, and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.

Statement 2 is also correct as a higher percentage of people in OECD countries are typically covered by public or mandatory private health insurance compared to the rest of the world. However, Statement 3 is incorrect as the '30 x 30' target does not relate to poverty eradication; it refers to a conservation target aiming to protect 30% of the Earth's land and oceans by 2030. Statement 4 is also incorrect as it states that cities and other urban areas are home to around 25% of humanity, whereas the actual percentage is much higher.
