        "answer": "B) Weight change but mass remains the same",
        "explanation": "The answer is Weight change but mass remains the same because when a body is taken from the earth to the moon, the mass of the body remains the same, but the weight changes. The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the center of the earth due to gravity, while mass is the amount of matter present in the object. Since the moon has less gravity than the earth, the weight of the body on the moon is less than its weight on the earth. However, the mass of the body remains the same, no matter where it is in the universe."

        "answer": "B) Sound",
        "explanation": "Decibel is used to measure the intensity field of B) Sound. The decibel (dB) is a unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, usually power or intensity. In acoustics, the decibel is used to quantify sound pressure levels that are perceived by the human ear. Sound pressure level (SPL) is the measure of the sound pressure relative to a reference value. The reference value is usually taken as the threshold of hearing, which is the sound pressure level of a sound wave with a frequency of 1,000 Hz and an amplitude of 20 micropascals. The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that a change of 10 dB represents a tenfold increase or decrease in sound pressure level. For example, a sound that is 10 times more intense than another sound has a sound pressure level that is 10 dB higher. The decibel scale is used to measure the intensity of sound in a variety of settings, including music, industry, and medicine."

Vegetable oils are a major dietary source of EFAs, particularly omega-6 fatty acids. Sunflower oil, mustard oil, and groundnut oil are rich sources of essential fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid. Coconut oil, on the other hand, is a saturated fat and does not contain significant amounts of essential fatty acids."

Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, including water, natural gas, coal, and biomass. When produced from renewable sources such as wind or solar power, hydrogen can be a completely emissions-free fuel. Hydrogen fuel cells are also highly efficient, with a conversion efficiency of up to 60%, compared to the 25% efficiency of internal combustion engines. Hydrogen is being increasingly used as a fuel in transportation, power generation, and industrial processes"

        "answer": "B) Water",
        "explanation": "Vegetables are easily perishable because of their high content of \"B) Water\". Vegetables are composed of a high percentage of water, which makes them highly perishable. When vegetables are harvested, they begin to lose moisture, which can lead to wilting, spoilage, and decay. The high water content of vegetables also makes them susceptible to bacterial growth, which can cause foodborne illness. To prevent spoilage and extend the shelf life of vegetables, they should be stored properly, such as in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator. Some vegetables can also be preserved by canning, freezing, or drying."

        "explanation": "Sweat mainly serves to eliminate \"A) Water\", NaCl. Sweat is produced by sweat glands in the skin and is composed mainly of water and sodium chloride (NaCl), also known as salt. The primary function of sweat is to regulate body temperature by cooling the skin through evaporation. When the body gets too hot, the sweat glands produce sweat, which is released onto the skin's surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the skin, helping to regulate body temperature. Sweat also helps to eliminate excess salt and other minerals from the body. However, sweat does not contain significant amounts of other substances such as dirt, serum, or enzymes."

Feed represents the major cost of poultry production, constituting up to 70 percent of the total cost. Poultry feed can vary depending on the bird\u2019s genetic strain and age and the surrounding environmental conditions, but most poultry feeds include grain, protein supplements, vitamin supplements, mineral supplements, and other preventative feed additives. The cost of feed depends on the cost of the ingredients, which can vary depending on supply and demand, weather, freight, and the quality of national crops. Therefore, the cost of feed is the most significant factor that influences the cost of poultry production."

        "explanation": "The correct statement is \"B) Fungal fermentation of rice is used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks\". Fungal fermentation of rice is used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks such as sake, a traditional Japanese rice wine. The process involves the use of a specific type of fungus called koji, which is added to steamed rice to initiate the fermentation process. The koji fungus breaks down the starch in the rice into simple sugars, which are then fermented by yeast to produce alcohol. Wheat bran is not rich in carbohydrates, but rather in fiber. Rice does not have antibiotic properties, but rather contains a variety of vitamins and minerals. Wheat contains carbohydrates, but not to the extent of 80-85%."

        "answer": "A) Elevation of boiling point of water by application of pressure",
        "explanation": "A pressure cooker works on the principle of \"A) Elevation of boiling point of water by application of pressure\". A pressure cooker is a sealed pot that uses steam pressure to cook food quickly. When water is heated in a pressure cooker, it produces steam, which increases the pressure inside the pot. The increased pressure raises the boiling point of water, allowing the food to cook at a higher temperature than it would in a regular pot. This results in faster cooking times and more tender food. The elevated pressure also helps to retain the nutrients and flavors of the food. The principle of a pressure cooker is based on the physical properties of water and the relationship between pressure and boiling point."

It was at this meeting that Radcliffe learned, apparently for the first time, that the boundary must be completed by August 15. He protested, but Mountbatten, Nehru, and Jinnah stood firm. In their rush to achieve their own political goals, British India\u2019s most powerful parties decided not to complete territorial partition before final political separation. This decision left Indian and Pakistani citizens in the peculiar predicament of not knowing which country they were in on August 15 or 16.
