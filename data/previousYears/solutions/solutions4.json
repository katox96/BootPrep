        "answer": "B) Ventricles have to pump blood into various organs",
        "explanation": "Ventricles have thicker muscular walls than atria because ventricles have to pump blood into various organs throughout the body. The ventricles are responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body (left ventricle) and pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation (right ventricle). The muscular walls of the ventricles need to be thicker and stronger to generate enough force to propel blood to different organs and overcome the resistance of the circulatory system. In contrast, the atria primarily receive blood from the veins and assist in filling the ventricles, requiring less force for their pumping function. Therefore, the thicker muscular walls of the ventricles are necessary to facilitate efficient blood circulation to various organs."

        "explanation": "The movement of the hand is not a reflex action. Reflex actions are involuntary and rapid responses to stimuli that occur without conscious thought or control. Breathing, heart-pumping, and salivation are examples of reflex actions. Breathing is regulated by the respiratory center in the brainstem, which responds to changes in carbon dioxide levels. Heart-pumping is controlled by the cardiac conduction system, which coordinates the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Salivation is a reflex action triggered by the presence or anticipation of food. In contrast, movement of the hand is typically a voluntary action that involves conscious thought and control. Therefore, among the given options, D) Movement of hand is not a reflex action."

        "answer": "D) Purple",
        "explanation": "The color of Litmus solution when it is neither acidic nor basic is purple. Litmus is a natural dye extracted from lichens and is commonly used as an indicator in chemistry. In its natural state, litmus is purple. When litmus is exposed to an acidic solution, it turns red, indicating acidity. On the other hand, when it comes into contact with a basic solution, it turns blue, indicating alkalinity. Therefore, in a neutral solution where the acidity and alkalinity are balanced, litmus solution retains its original purple color."

Some bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), are highly soluble in water and are referred to as alkalis. However, there are certain bases, such as metal oxides or metal hydroxides, that have limited solubility in water. For example, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), commonly known as lime, has low solubility in water. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that all bases are soluble in water."

        "answer": "C) Power",
        "explanation": "In pH, 'p' represents the power. pH is a scale used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It is based on the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. The power symbolized by 'p' indicates the exponential nature of the pH scale. Each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. For example, a solution with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4. Therefore, 'p' in pH signifies the power or exponential relationship between hydrogen ion concentration and acidity/alkalinity."

        "answer": "B) Violet",
        "explanation": "During dispersion of white light by a glass prism, violet light bends the most. When white light passes through a prism, it gets separated into its constituent colors due to the phenomenon of dispersion. This occurs because different colors of light have different wavelengths and hence different refractive indices in the prism. Violet light has the shortest wavelength among the visible colors, and it experiences the highest degree of refraction or bending as it passes through the prism. On the other hand, red light, which has the longest wavelength, bends the least. Therefore, among the given options, B) Violet light bends the most during dispersion of white light by a glass prism."

        "answer": "B) Refraction of starlight",
        "explanation": "The twinkling of stars is primarily caused by the refraction of starlight. When starlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters different layers of air with varying densities and temperatures. These variations in the density of air act as a medium for the refraction of light. As the starlight passes through these different layers, it undergoes bending or refraction due to the changes in the refractive index of the air. This bending of starlight leads to the apparent twinkling effect that we observe. Therefore, among the given options, B) Refraction of starlight is responsible for the twinkling of stars."
