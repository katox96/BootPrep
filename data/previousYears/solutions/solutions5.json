Unlike solar and wind energy, which are renewable and derive power from natural resources such as sunlight and wind, nuclear energy is generated through the process of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors use uranium or plutonium as fuel, and these resources are finite and non-renewable. Once the fuel is consumed, it cannot be replenished. Therefore, nuclear energy is classified as a non-renewable source of energy."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is B) Litre. The fundamental units in the International System of Units (SI) are meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. These units are considered fundamental because they are base units from which all other units are derived. The liter, on the other hand, is a derived unit of volume in the SI system. It is equal to 1 cubic decimeter, and its symbol is 'L'. While the liter is widely used in everyday life for measuring liquids, it is not considered a fundamental unit."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is C) Mercury. Mercury is the liquid used in a clinical thermometer. Mercury is a heavy, silvery metal that is liquid at room temperature. It has a high coefficient of expansion, which means it expands and contracts significantly with changes in temperature. This property makes it suitable for use in thermometers to measure body temperature. However, due to the toxic nature of mercury, alternative substances like alcohol or digital thermometers are now commonly used in place of mercury thermometers."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is A) Erect and diminished. A convex mirror is a curved mirror that bulges outward. When an object is placed in front of a convex mirror, the reflected rays diverge or spread out. As a result, the image formed by a convex mirror is virtual, erect (upright), and diminished in size. The image appears smaller than the actual object. Convex mirrors are commonly used as side-view mirrors in vehicles to provide a wider field of view."

It provides us with abundant solar energy that can be harnessed and converted into various forms of usable energy, such as solar power and solar thermal energy. Solar power is generated by using photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity, while solar thermal energy is obtained by capturing the heat from the Sun and using it for heating or generating electricity. Unlike fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, which are finite and non-renewable, the Sun's energy is continuously available and will not deplete over time."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is D) Increase in sea levels. Global warming, primarily caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, has led to the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. This melting ice contributes to the rise in sea levels worldwide. As the Earth's temperature increases, the ice melts, adding more water to the oceans and causing sea levels to rise. This phenomenon poses significant challenges to coastal communities, as higher sea levels can lead to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and the displacement of populations living in low-lying areas."

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy to produce glucose and release oxygen. This process takes place in the chloroplasts, which are specialized organelles found in plant cells. Chloroplasts contain a pigment called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and initiates the photosynthetic reaction. Inside the chloroplasts, the light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes, and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur in the stroma. Through photosynthesis, plants play a vital role in converting sunlight into usable energy and producing oxygen as a byproduct."

Bone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue found inside certain bones, such as the sternum, ribs, pelvis, and long bones. It is responsible for the production of various types of blood cells, including RBCs. The process of RBC formation is known as erythropoiesis. In the bone marrow, stem cells called hematopoietic stem cells differentiate and mature into RBCs under the influence of the hormone erythropoietin. RBCs play a crucial role in transporting oxygen to tissues and removing carbon dioxide from the body."

It is primarily caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in maintaining good vision, particularly in dim light conditions. It is essential for the proper functioning of the retina, which is responsible for converting light into nerve signals that are sent to the brain for visual perception. A deficiency of Vitamin A can lead to impaired vision, especially in low light situations, and can be addressed by consuming foods rich in Vitamin A or taking Vitamin A supplements."

Soft iron is preferred for transformer cores due to its high magnetic permeability, which allows it to efficiently conduct magnetic flux. The core serves as a pathway for the magnetic field generated by the primary winding of the transformer, enabling the transfer of energy between the primary and secondary windings. Soft iron has the ability to magnetize and demagnetize quickly, making it suitable for transformers where the magnetic field needs to alternate rapidly. Its high magnetic permeability also helps minimize energy losses in the transformer."

        "answer": "A) Glaciers",
        "explanation": "The answer is A) Glaciers. An outwash plain is a feature formed by the deposition of sediments carried by meltwater from a glacier. When a glacier melts, it releases large amounts of water that flow away from the glacier, carrying sediments with it. These sediments are then deposited in the form of a flat or gently sloping plain known as an outwash plain. The outwash plain is typically composed of sand, gravel, and other debris left behind by the meltwater. This process is commonly associated with glacial activity. "

        "explanation": "The concept of the Normal Cycle of Erosion was given by A) Davis, W.M. William Morris Davis, an American geographer, is credited with formulating the Normal Cycle of Erosion. According to this concept, landforms undergo a series of sequential stages as they are shaped by erosion processes over time. These stages include youth, maturity, and old age. Davis proposed that landscapes go through a cyclical pattern of erosion, deposition, and uplift, ultimately resulting in a smoother and more rounded landform. His work significantly contributed to the understanding of landform development and the processes of erosion and deposition. "

        "explanation": "The term \"Ria\" stands for A) A submerged river valley. Rias are coastal features formed when sea levels rise and flood the lower portion of a river valley. As the sea fills the valley, it creates a long, narrow inlet with steep sides. Rias are typically characterized by deep water channels, irregular coastlines, and numerous islands. They are commonly found in regions where rivers flow into the ocean and experience significant tidal influences. Rias are important ecosystems and often support diverse marine life. "

        "answer": "D) Wind action",
        "explanation": "The term \"deflation\" is associated with D) Wind action. Deflation refers to the process of wind removing loose surface material such as sand, silt, and dust from the Earth's surface. It occurs in arid and desert regions where there is limited vegetation to anchor the soil. As the wind blows over the surface, it picks up and carries away the loose particles, causing erosion and the formation of various landforms such as sand dunes and desert pavements. Deflation can have significant impacts on the landscape and can contribute to desertification. "

        "explanation": "The rate of decrease of temperature in the troposphere is B) 6.4 degrees Celsius. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, extending from the surface up to an altitude of approximately 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) at the poles and 17 kilometers (11 miles) at the equator. As we move higher in the troposphere, the temperature decreases with increasing altitude at an average rate of 6.4 degrees Celsius per kilometer. This temperature change is known as the lapse rate. "
