Volcanic activity has been a continuous process throughout Earth's history, and it has played a significant role in shaping the composition of the atmosphere. During volcanic eruptions, gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor are released into the atmosphere. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a significant change in the history of the Earth's atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels led to the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.","rating":0,"subject":"geo","type":"Chronology","liked":1,"disliked":0,"attempts":8,"correctAttempts":1,"wrongAttempts":7,"questionId":13},{"_id":14,"question":"Match the following lists:","listI":{"items":["A) Convention on Biological Diversity","B) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","C) Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants","D) Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade"],"heading":"International Environmental Conventions"},"listII":{"items":["1) Aims to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity","2) Aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere","3) Aims to protect human health and environment from hazardous chemicals","4) Aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international trade of hazardous chemicals"],"heading":"Description"},"options":["A) A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4","B) A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3","C) A-3, B-2, C-1, D-4","D) A-2, B-3, C-4, D-1"],"answer":"C)","explanation":["Convention on Biological Diversity -> Aims to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity","United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -> Aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere","Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants -> Aims to protect human health and environment from hazardous chemicals","Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade -> Aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international trade of hazardous chemicals."],"rating":0,"subject":"Environmental Science","type":"List","liked":0,"disliked":0,"attempts":6,"correctAttempts":3,"wrongAttempts":3,"questionId":14},{"_id":15,"question":"As per Article 324 of the Constitution, which of the following is true about the composition of the Election Commission?","answer":"C) The President may appoint regional commissioners to assist the Election Commission","explanation":"As per Article 324 of the Constitution, the President may appoint after consultation with the election commission such regional commissioners as he may consider necessary to assist the election commission.","subject":"Political Science","rating":0,"type":"MCQ","liked":0,"disliked":0,"attempts":8,"correctAttempts":1,"wrongAttempts":7,"questionId":15,"options":["A) The Election Commission consists of only the Chief Election Commissioner","B) The appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other election commissioners is made by the Prime Minister","C) The President may appoint regional commissioners to assist the Election Commission","D) The tenure of office of the election commissioners is determined by the Chief Election Commissioner"]},{"_id":16,"question":"Which of the following statements are true about the Central Vigilance Commission?","statements":["A) The CVC is a single-member body consisting of a Central Vigilance Commissioner.","B) The CVC is appointed by the Prime Minister of India.","C) The CVC and vigilance commissioners hold office for a term of four years or until they attain the age of sixty-five years, whichever is earlier.","D) The president can remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity."],"options":["A) A and B","B) B and C","C) C and D","D) A and D"],"answer":"C) C and D","explanation":"Statement A is incorrect as the CVC is a multi-member body consisting of a Central Vigilance Commissioner (chairperson) and not more than two vigilance commissioners.
